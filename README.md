# Ansible Playbook to subscribe existing systems to a Satellite 6

This playbook is the universal tool to subscribe existing or new systems to a Satellite server.

The following use cases are covered:
* System is not subscribed at all and needs to registred to a Satellite Server
* System is subscribed to a medieval Satellite 5.x system which is not supported anymore since years and needs to be migrated to a recent Satellite 6 server
* System is subscribed to a Satellite 6 and needs to be migrated to another Satellite
* System is subscribed to the Red Hat CDN and needs to be migrated to a Satellite 6 server
* System can be put into a hostgroup and an initial Ansible Play can be triggered to apply the roles defined in the hostgroup 
* SSH remote execution SSH public key of the Satellite or Capsule (depending where you run the playbook, Satellite or Capusle) will be deployed on the target systems

In the case of CDN or a previous subscription to another Satellite, the systems are unregistred to not have a double usage of subscriptions. However, it does *not* unsubscribe the system from the Satellite 5, in the case of a problem there is an easy backout plan.

# Requirements

The only requirement is to have subscription-manager installed, otherwise there will be a chicken and egg problem. Well, of course you need to have an Ansible Control Node needs to be the Satellite itself, or a Capsule Server. In the later case, you need to install the Satellite Ansible collection with *dnf install ansible-collection-redhat-satellite.noarch ansible-collection-redhat-satellite_operations.noarch*

## Usage

First you need to copy the vars.yml.dist to vars.yml and passwd.yml.dist to passwd.yml. The default password for th vaul file passwd.yml is "changeme". 

Set a new password for the passwd.yml using *ansible-vault rekey passwd.yml* 
Edit the passwd.yml and change the Satellite password to what you are actually us in your environment. This can be done with  *ansible-vault edit passwd.yml*

The variables are mostly set in the inventory files, so you can run the playbook for all servers at once. Be aware to first test the proper configuration in a lab environment.

You can set the variables for capsule, which can be the Satellite itself or an actual Capsule, the Satellite the organization name in the vars.yml. The hosts specific vars go to the inventory file

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory -u root -k subscribe_system_to_sat6.yml
```
